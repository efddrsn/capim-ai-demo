# GitHub Pages Analysis Report

## Investigation Summary

I've thoroughly investigated the GitHub Pages site for `efddrsn/capim-ai-demo` using various tools and methods. Here are my findings:

## ✅ Current Status: **WORKING**

The GitHub Pages site at `https://efddrsn.github.io/capim-ai-demo/` is actually **functioning correctly** from a technical deployment perspective.

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Server Response Analysis
- **HTTP Status**: `200 OK` 
- **Content-Type**: `text/html; charset=utf-8`
- **Last Modified**: `Wed, 16 Jul 2025 18:58:41 GMT`
- **Server**: `GitHub.com`

### 2. Deployment Infrastructure
- **GitHub Actions Workflow**: `Deploy to GitHub Pages` (.github/workflows/deploy.yml)
- **Latest Deployment**: Run #11 - **SUCCESS** (completed at 18:58:48Z)
- **Build Tool**: Vite (React application)
- **Base Path**: Correctly configured as `/capim-ai-demo/`

### 3. Content Analysis
The site is serving a React application with:
- ✅ Valid HTML structure
- ✅ Proper asset references with correct base path
- ✅ JavaScript bundles loading successfully
- ✅ CSS stylesheets loading properly

### 4. Recent Git History
- Latest commit: `73cdf20` - "Add package-lock.json for proper npm caching"
- Recent fixes for npm caching issues
- Removal of conflicting Jekyll workflow

## Potential Issues & Troubleshooting

### If the page appears "not working" to users:

1. **Browser Cache Issues**
   - Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
   - Clear browser cache
   - Try in incognito/private mode

2. **React Application Loading**
   - The page shows minimal HTML initially
   - JavaScript must load to render the React app
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors

3. **Asset Loading**
   - CSS: `/capim-ai-demo/assets/index-C6rGie1m.css`
   - JS: `/capim-ai-demo/assets/index-C7ZTGT_W.js`
   - Both are loading successfully

### GitHub Status Check
No current GitHub incidents affecting Pages or Actions services.

## Recommendations

1. **Add Loading State**: Consider adding a loading indicator in the HTML for better UX
2. **Error Boundaries**: Implement React error boundaries to catch runtime errors
3. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring to track page load performance
4. **Documentation**: Update README with troubleshooting steps for users

## Configuration Details

### Vite Configuration (vite.config.ts)
```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  base: '/capim-ai-demo/'  // ✅ Correctly configured
})
```

### GitHub Actions Workflow
- ✅ Proper permissions (pages: write, id-token: write)
- ✅ Correct artifact upload from `dist` directory
- ✅ Using latest Actions versions (v4)

## Conclusion

The GitHub Pages deployment is working correctly. If users report the page "not working," it's likely due to:
1. Browser caching issues
2. JavaScript loading/runtime errors
3. Network connectivity issues
4. Expecting immediate content (React app needs to load)

The infrastructure and deployment pipeline are functioning as expected.
